            Fun Fact! My full name is Sri NagaSai Siva Balaji Paladugu. From an early age, I was interested in computers
            and how they work. At the age of 6, I started using Microsoft Office as I was fascinated by the vast amount
            of things you can create using the tools in Microsoft Powerpoint, Microsoft Word, and Microsoft Paint. When
            I was 10 years old, I started learning how to create webpages using HTML and CSS with the help of Khan
            Academy. The reason why I like Computer Science is because there is an infinite number of things you can
            learn because new technologies are being released everyday. The main motivation for any programmer in this
            industry is the thrust for new information and making applications better. I have been in five different
            states in the U.S. My favorite subjects are Math and History.
